# Description

    This was the first project I did for my coding bootcamp. The project was to debug and clean up an existing code.
    I made the following changes.
        - I changed the title from "website" to "Horiseon."
        - I added the missing id "search-engine-optimization" under the class "content" to allow the corresponding hyperlink on the navigation bar to work.
        - I added an alt for every img.
        - I added a header, main and footer element. As well as splitting the "content" and "benefits" classes into their own section element to clean up the html.
        - I changed the heading on the footer from h2 to h4 to put the heading elements in order. As well as adjusting the css to correspond with this change.
        - I moved around the code in the style.css to put it all in sequential order.
        - I added comment to the css to describe what does what on the webpage and where it is.
